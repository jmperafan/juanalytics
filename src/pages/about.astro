      <div style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
        <p>
          I'm Juan Manuel Perafan, an Analytics Engineer based in Utrecht, Netherlands.
          Born and raised in Colombia, I've been living in the Netherlands since 2011.
        </p>

        <p>
          My ideal working week involves learning new technologies, debugging code, writing
          difficult calculations, teaching organizations about data, and networking at a
          conference/Meetup.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What I Do</h2>

        <p>
          I help organizations make their data reflect their actual business reality. Technology should
          adapt to how your business operates, not the other way around. Data systems should integrate
          with your processes, not force you to create new ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          With nearly a decade of experience in data (mostly as an implementation consultant), I work at
          the intersection of hands-on engineering, people development, and organizational culture through
          data governance.
        </p>
