# Episode 20 - Becoming a volunteer for Django Girls - SQL Lingua Franca #7

ðŸ“º Full Episode: https://youtu.be/A5TOnCdsJlo

Django Girls: https://djangogirls.org/en/amsterdam/

In this podcast segment, we discuss ways to get involved with Django Girls beyond attending as a participant. Our guest encourages experienced Python programmers to consider volunteering as coaches for the workshops. Here's what potential coaches should know:

1. Coach applications are open and can be found on the Django Girls website.
2. Coaching is on a volunteer basis (unpaid).
3. Knowledge of Python is sufficient - familiarity with Django is not required, as coaches can prepare using available tutorials.
4. The workshops provide an opportunity to support the goal of bringing more women into IT.

For companies interested in supporting Django Girls:
1. Sponsorship opportunities are available for upcoming and future workshops.
2. Sponsors can provide financial support or offer their space to host events.
3. Workshops are organized every six months, so there are recurring opportunities to get involved.

If you're an experienced Python developer or represent a company that wants to support diversity in tech, consider reaching out to Django Girls Amsterdam. Whether through coaching or sponsorship, your involvement can help make programming more accessible to women in your community.
