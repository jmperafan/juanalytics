# Episode 17: From Psychology to Analytics Engineering

I was honored to be featured on the **Data Career Transformations** podcast, where I shared my unconventional journey into analytics engineering.

## My Journey

### Starting Point: Psychology
I studied psychology and never imagined I'd end up in the data world. But the analytical thinking skills I developed proved invaluable in my later career.

### The Pivot
In 2017, I made my first steps into analytics. It wasn't a straight path - it involved:
- Learning SQL and data visualization
- Understanding business intelligence tools
- Discovering the power of data storytelling

### Finding Analytics Engineering
When I discovered dbt in 2020, everything clicked. Analytics engineering combined:
- Technical rigor of engineering
- Analytical thinking from my psychology background
- Business impact through data-driven insights

## Key Lessons

### 1. Your Background is an Asset
My psychology background helps me:
- Understand user needs better
- Communicate complex ideas clearly
- Lead meetups and communities effectively

### 2. Community Matters
Getting involved in the dbt community accelerated my growth:
- Attending Coalesce 2021 was transformative
- Starting the Amsterdam dbt Meetup connected me with amazing people
- Teaching others deepens your own understanding

### 3. Continuous Learning
The data field evolves rapidly:
- Stay curious
- Attend conferences and meetups
- Share what you learn

## For Career Changers

If you're considering a career change into data:
- **Your unique background is valuable** - don't discount it
- **Start with the fundamentals** - SQL, basic statistics, visualization
- **Join communities** - they're incredibly welcoming
- **Build projects** - practical experience matters more than certifications
