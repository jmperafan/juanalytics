# Episode 18 - KPI Masterclass - SQL Lingua Franca #7

ðŸ“º Full Episode: https://youtu.be/A5TOnCdsJlo

This segment discusses the importance of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in regulatory compliance for fintech companies. The guest explains that regulators use these KPIs to assess if processes are running effectively. Key points include:

KPI definition is sensitive, as companies must commit to achieving certain metrics regularly.
There's a need to balance stakeholder desires for numerous KPIs with realistic compliance expectations.
Good KPIs are reasonable, reflect the overall process health, and are typically few in number (3-4 for IT processes).
Examples of effective KPIs include response time and resolution time for incident management.
It's important to consider how KPIs correlate with each other and avoid focusing on one metric at the expense of others.
Bad KPIs can include unrealistic targets or metrics that don't fairly represent process performance.

The discussion emphasizes the importance of choosing KPIs carefully, understanding their implications, and providing context when reporting results. It also touches on the challenges of working with ratios and the need to present data in a meaningful, actionable way.
