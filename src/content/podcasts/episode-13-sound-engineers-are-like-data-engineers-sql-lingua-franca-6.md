# Episode 13 - Sound Engineers are like Data Engineers - SQL Lingua Franca #6

ðŸ“º Full Episode: https://youtu.be/Sl5jEuxJ9G0

In this video, Luuk reflects on his unique career journey from the music industry to IT recruitment. He discusses how his experience as a music producer and sound engineer translated into skills that are valuable in data engineering. Luuk highlights that both sound engineers and data engineers share key traits, such as attention to detail, a passion for experimenting with new tools, and the drive to constantly learn. He also emphasizes the importance of sharing knowledge, noting how teaching others helped him grow in both fields.

Luuk explains that, much like in data engineering, working as a sound engineer involves a deep understanding of the technical aspects of the tools used. This love for the technical side made his transition to IT recruitment easier, as he was already familiar with many of the concepts. He encourages others to embrace knowledge sharing, as it not only helps the community but also leads to personal growth and new insights.
