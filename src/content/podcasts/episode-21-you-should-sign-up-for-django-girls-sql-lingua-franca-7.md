# Episode 21 - You should sign up for Django Girls  - SQL Lingua Franca #7

ðŸ“º Full Episode: https://youtu.be/A5TOnCdsJlo

Django Girls: https://djangogirls.org/en/amsterdam/

In this podcast excerpt, we discuss Django Girls, a non-profit organization offering free programming workshops for women. Our guest, a workshop coach and organizer, explains how these one-day events teach Python programming to beginners. Participants learn to create a basic web application using the Django framework, along with an introduction to Git version control and website deployment. The workshops are designed for women who are new to coding or unsure if programming is for them. We cover the workshop's structure, the tools used (all free or open-source), and how it gives participants a taste of a developer's job. If you're a woman interested in trying programming, or know someone who might be, this episode provides useful information about upcoming workshops and how to get involved. With a shortage of tech professionals, initiatives like Django Girls aim to introduce more people to potential careers in programming.
