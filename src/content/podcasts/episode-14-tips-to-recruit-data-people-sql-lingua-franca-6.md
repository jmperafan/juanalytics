# Episode 14 - Tips to recruit data people - SQL Lingua Franca #6

ðŸ“º Full Episode: https://youtu.be/Sl5jEuxJ9G0

In this video, Luuk shares expert tips on recruiting data professionals and how it differs from hiring for other roles. He explains that data candidates can easily showcase their skills through portfolios, GitHub repositories, or technical assessments, allowing recruiters to quickly determine their technical proficiency. Luuk also emphasizes the importance of highlighting exciting projects and opportunities within the company, as top data professionals are often drawn to teams where they can learn from others and work on cutting-edge technology.

When it comes to non-technical roles, such as managers, Luuk notes that evaluating qualities like networking and communication skills can be more subjective. To address this, he suggests creating clear, standardized definitions of what the company is looking for in these roles, ensuring consistency across interviews. This approach helps remove personal bias and provides a structured way to assess candidates for traits that are harder to measure.
