# Welcome to Juanalytics!

I'm excited to launch this new space where I'll be sharing my journey and insights in the world of analytics engineering, data visualization, and community building.

## What to Expect

On this site, you'll find:

- **Blog posts** about analytics engineering best practices, dbt tips, and modern data stack insights
- **Videos** from meetups, conferences, and tutorials
- **Podcast episodes** featuring conversations with data professionals

## Why Analytics Engineering?

Analytics engineering bridges the gap between data engineering and data analysis. It's about:

- Building reliable, tested data transformations
- Creating clear data models that everyone can understand
- Empowering analysts to work independently
- Fostering a culture of data quality

## Building Community

One of my greatest passions is building and nurturing data communities. Through the Amsterdam dbt Meetup, Analytics Engineering Meetup, and Netherlands Data Visualization Meetup, I've seen firsthand how powerful it is when data professionals come together to share knowledge and learn from each other.

## Stay Connected

I'm always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmperafan/) or check out my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/juanalytics) for all the ways to connect.

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you!
