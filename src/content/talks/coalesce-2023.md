# dbt Performance Optimization Tips

Presented at Coalesce 2023, dbt's annual conference.

## Talk Overview

As dbt projects grow, performance becomes increasingly important. In this talk, I shared practical strategies for optimizing dbt model performance including:

- Choosing the right materialization strategy
- Proper use of incremental models
- Query optimization techniques
- Leveraging warehouse-specific features
- Measuring and tracking performance over time

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with the right materialization** - Understanding when to use tables, views, incremental, or ephemeral models
2. **Optimize incrementally** - Best practices for incremental models and handling late-arriving data
3. **Measure everything** - Using dbt artifacts to track performance trends
